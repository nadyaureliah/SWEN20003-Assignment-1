# SWEN20003-Assignment-1

This project is a simulation of **Shadow Treasure**, a treasure hunt game. In this project (Assignment 1), 
we focused on creating the graphical interface and implementing the interactions between the characters in
the game.

## Treasure Hunt Game

The Player enters a tomb to search for a treasure box. The tomb is filled with zombies, that the
Player needs to fight before reaching the treasure. While the fighting is energy-consuming, the
tomb is also filled with the nutritious foods to let the Player regain strength.
In Project 1, you will implement three entities: the Player; a zombie; and a sandwich; and the basic
interactions between them. There is only one player in the treasure hunt game. For Project 1,
there is one zombie and one sandwich. The character and function descriptions of the Player,
zombie and sandwich are outlined below.

## Documentation
